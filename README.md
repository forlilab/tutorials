# Tutorials for the AutoDock Suite


## Installation

There are currently two tutorials for installing our software:

 - [on linux](installation-linux)
 - [on macOS](installation-mac)

For Windows, it should be possible to run our software from the command line
or from PowerShell, but we have not tested either. The Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL) seems to have various issues reported on the internet. However,
Linux can be installed alongside Windows, known as dual boot.
This requires creating a disk partition in which Linux will be installed,
which needs to be done carefully to not erase data. Probably, a disk with
sufficient free space that is being used by Windows needs to be
re-partitioned to create a new partiion to install Linux. Backing up all disks
is highly recommended as mistakes are consequential.
Kubuntu and Ubuntu are popular choices of Linux distributions.

Soon, we will add a tutorial in which part of matinib will be identified in
a small virtual screen.
