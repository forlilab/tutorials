# Tutorials for the AutoDock Suite


## Installation

There are currently two tutorials for installing our software:

 - [on linux](installation-linux)
 - [on macOS](installation-mac)

Feel free to open Issues here on GitHub if you encounter any problems.
The "Issues" tab is the second from the left at the top of this page.

### Windows

It should be possible to run our software from the command line
or from PowerShell, but we have not tested either. The Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL) seems to have various issues reported on the internet. A solution
is to install Linux alongside Windows, known as dual boot.
This requires creating a disk partition in which Linux will be installed,
which needs to be done carefully to not erase data. Probably, a disk with
sufficient free space that is being used by Windows needs to be
re-partitioned to create a new partiion to install Linux. Backing up all disks
is highly recommended as mistakes are consequential.
Kubuntu and Ubuntu are popular choices of Linux distributions.



## Virtual screening workshop

Covers the identification of part of a known drug, imatinib, and the process of using
docking to support early drug discovery.
